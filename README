Shroud is a simple secret manager with a command line interface.  The
password database is stored as a Scheme s-expression and encrypted
with a [[gnupg.org][GnuPG]] key.

Each secret is indentified by a unique name and may contain an
arbitrary set of key/value data pairs.

* Usage

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    # Add a new secret:
    shroud hide bank-account username=foobar password=hackme

    # Edit an existing secret:
    shroud hide --edit bank-account password=hackmepls

    # List all secrets:
    shroud list

    # Show all key/value pairs for a saved secret:
    shroud show bank-account

    # Show a single value in a secret:
    shroud show bank-account password

    # Copy a password directly to X clipboard:
    shroud show -c bank-account password

    # Delete a secret:
    shroud remove bank-account
  #+END_SRC

* Dependencies

  - GNU Guile >= 2.0.11
  - GnuPG >= 1.4

* Installation

  Shroud uses the familiar GNU build system.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ./bootstrap && ./configure && make && make install
  #+END_SRC

  Depending on your chosen installation prefix via the =--prefix=
  option to the configure script (which defaults to =/usr/local=,
  users may need to setup the =GUILE_LOAD_PATH= and
  =GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH= environment variables to include the
  directory where Shroud's Guile modules were installed.

  For example, GNU Bash users may add the following snippet to their
  =$HOME/.bash_profile=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=/usr/local/share/guile/2.0
    export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=/usr/local/share/guile/2.0
    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
  #+END_SRC
