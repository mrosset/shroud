Shroud is a simple secret manager with a command line interface.  The
password database is stored as a Scheme s-expression and encrypted
with a [[gnupg.org][GnuPG]] key.

Each secret is indentified by a unique name and may contain an
arbitrary set of key/value data pairs.

* Usage

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    # Add a new secret:
    shroud hide bank-account username=foobar password=hackme

    # Edit an existing secret:
    shroud hide --edit bank-account password=hackmepls

    # List all secrets:
    shroud list

    # Show all key/value pairs for a saved secret:
    shroud show bank-account

    # Show a single value in a secret:
    shroud show bank-account password

    # Delete a secret
    shroud remove bank-account
  #+END_SRC

  - GnuPG >= 1.4
